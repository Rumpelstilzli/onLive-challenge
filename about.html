        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>The OnLife Challenge was conceived by Computational Social Science students during the Deprogramming Camp. 
        Currently, the state of the project is a conceptual intervention titled the OnLife Challenge. 
        In this endeavour, participants are motivated to abstain from using social media for a span of two weeks. 
        We opted not to solely banish social media access using an app during this period 
        because we felt the temptation to migrate to another engrossing platform on their smartphones would be overwhelming. 
        Instead, we aimed to cultivate a genuine shift in behaviour, 
        prompting participants to explore alternative coping mechanisms offline. 
        For that we want the participants to take a step back and stop using their phone entirely. 
        Recognizing that contemporary life mandates some electronic device usage, 
        we furnish participants with a Nokia Banana phone (a feature phone). 
        This component is pivotal, ensuring the challenge gains visibility, 
        enticing peers and potentially sparking their interest.</p>

            So, what's our bone of contention with social media? 
        </h3>
        <p>At the onset of our project, we posed the research question: 
            "Does the quantity of screen time influence the academic achievements of college students aged 18-25?"
             In our research journey, we encountered a study suggesting evidence supporting this notion, 
             but it was applicable only for individuals exhibiting addictive behaviours. 
             However, since this study sampled Pakistan students, 
             we embarked on a sister study to ascertain if these findings resonated with students at the University of Amsterdam. 
             In another study, we discerned that students who actively engaged with social media academically outperformed those who abstained from it entirely. 
             From this, we inferred that judicious use of social media has its merits. 
             Through our challenge, we aspire to ignite conversations around harnessing social media collectively in a manner that's advantageous to us, 
             while being cognizant of its prospective detrimental impacts</p>
