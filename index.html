        <p>Does the Matrix have you? Do you feel like you're spending too much time online?</p>
        <p>We all know this feeling all too well. 
            However, when we try to act on it, we often find ourselves back online just moments later. 
            This makes one wonder: Who's in control, you or your phone? 
            But the problem isn't you; it's the design of our “Brave new World”. 
            It's crafted to be irresistible. 
            You might be feeling its pull right now.</p>
        <p>Want to break free from this cycle?</p>

        <h3>Consider the On-Life Challenge.</h3>
            </header>

        <p>In the On-Life Challenge, you are going to quit social media for two weeks. 
            You'll quit using your phone entirely. 
            We understand that modern life demands certain digital essentials. 
            That's why we provide a phone with limited capabilities. 
            It supports WhatsApp and Google Maps to keep you connected with your loved ones, but it lacks the addictive features. 
            This phone, the new Nokia Banana phone, emphasizes Low-Tech over High-Tech. 
            It's will restore control back into your hands, allowing you to introspect about your habits and, 
            hopefully, teaching you how to spend your time more effectively even after the challenge concludes.</p>

        <p>Complete the challenge and you'll earn stylish Matrix-inspired sunglasses and exclusive On-Life merchandise.</p>
        <p>You can choose to keep your smartphone during the challenge, 
            or you can hand it over to us if you believe it will help reduce your usage. 
            If you decide to retain your phone, we will install tracking software that will reveal at the end whether you truly refrained from using social media.</p>
