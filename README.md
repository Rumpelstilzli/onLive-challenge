Given that we are creating a simple static website with HTML and CSS, there are no classes, functions, or methods to define as these are not used in HTML or CSS. The core components of this project will be the HTML files for each page of the website and a CSS file for the styling. 

Here are the files we will create:

1. index.html: This is the home page of the website.
2. about.html: This page provides information about the project.
3. challenge.html: This page provides information about the challenge.
4. contact.html: This page contains a contact form.
5. style.css: This file contains all the CSS styles for the website.

Let's start with the entrypoint file, which is index.html:
